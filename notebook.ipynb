    "**The Problem**\n",
    "Navigating extensive legal and technical documents, such as the Philippine DOLE Occupational Safety and Health Standards (OSHS), presents a significant \"information bottleneck.\" Finding specific compliance metrics, hazard guidelines, or equipment specifications via manual search is inefficient and prone to human error. Furthermore, while standard Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly capable conversational agents, they cannot be trusted with critical safety queries out-of-the-box because they are prone to \"hallucinating\" technical facts and lack innate knowledge of localized policy documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose and Domain Use Case**\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to develop an LLM-powered chatbot tailored specifically to the domain of workplace safety policies and manuals. The intended use case is to serve as an interactive safety assistant for safety officers, employers, and workers. Users can query the system in natural language (e.g., \"What are the required dimensions for a machine guard?\") and the chatbot will instantly retrieve and synthesize the exact procedural guidelines and compliance protocols from the official DOLE OSHS text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Significance**\n",
    "Building a retrieval-grounded conversational system (utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG pipeline) is critical for this application. By anchoring the LLM's responses exclusively to retrieved chunks of the official OSHS document, we eliminate hallucinations and guarantee that the information provided is factual, reliable, and citeable. In a real-world setting, this system accelerates regulatory compliance, democratizes access to dense safety protocols, and ultimately helps mitigate workplace hazards by ensuring accurate safety knowledge is instantly accessible.\n",
