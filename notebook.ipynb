    "\n",
    "**The Problem**\n",
    "Navigating extensive legal and technical documents, such as the Philippine DOLE Occupational Safety and Health Standards (OSHS), presents a significant \"information bottleneck.\" Finding specific compliance metrics, hazard guidelines, or equipment specifications via manual search is inefficient and prone to human error. Furthermore, while standard Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly capable conversational agents, they cannot be trusted with critical safety queries out-of-the-box because they are prone to \"hallucinating\" technical facts and lack innate knowledge of localized policy documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose and Domain Use Case**\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to develop an LLM-powered chatbot tailored specifically to the domain of workplace safety policies and manuals. The intended use case is to serve as an interactive safety assistant for safety officers, employers, and workers. Users can query the system in natural language (e.g., \"What are the required dimensions for a machine guard?\") and the chatbot will instantly retrieve and synthesize the exact procedural guidelines and compliance protocols from the official DOLE OSHS text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Significance**\n",
    "Building a retrieval-grounded conversational system (utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation or RAG pipeline) is critical for this application. By anchoring the LLM's responses exclusively to retrieved chunks of the official OSHS document, we eliminate hallucinations and guarantee that the information provided is factual, reliable, and citeable. In a real-world setting, this system accelerates regulatory compliance, democratizes access to dense safety protocols, and ultimately helps mitigate workplace hazards by ensuring accurate safety knowledge is instantly accessible.\n",

    "## Section 2. Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge Source and Collection**\n",
    "The primary knowledge source for this chatbot is the **Occupational Safety and Health Standards (OSHS) As Amended** handbook, issued by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) of the Philippines. The document was acquired as a digital PDF (closed-corpus) and serves as the definitive legal and regulatory baseline for occupational safety in the country. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Structure**\n",
    "* **Format:** Single PDF document (`Osh-Handbook.pdf`)\n",
    "* **Domain:** Legal, Regulatory, and Occupational Health & Safety\n",
    "* **Contents:** The document is highly structured, consisting of hierarchical legal frameworks (Rules, Sections, Sub-sections) alongside dense technical matrices (e.g., Threshold Limit Values for airborne contaminants, medical supply requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing and Data Pipeline**\n",
    "To ensure the LLM accurately retrieves and contextualizes the legal statutes without hallucination, standard naive chunking was discarded in favor of a **Structure-Aware Processing Pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Document Cleaning:** * **Artifact Removal:** Page numbers, headers, and extraneous source tags (e.g., `--- PAGE X ---`) were stripped using Regular Expressions to reduce embedding noise.\n",
    "    * **Hyphenation Merging:** Words split across line breaks by hyphens (e.g., \"equip-ment\") were systematically rejoined to maintain semantic integrity during vector search.\n",
    "2.  **Handling Tables:** * Complex tables embedded within the PDF are extracted independently using `pdfplumber`. These tables are converted into Markdown format before embedding to preserve their row-column relationships, ensuring that specific numerical limits and chemical properties remain explicitly linked to their respective entities.\n",
    "3.  **Structure-Aware Chunking & Metadata Tagging:** * The text is strictly partitioned using **Rule Numbers** (e.g., \"Rule 1040\") as the primary delimiters. \n",
    "    * **Context Injection:** To prevent orphaned text chunks from losing their legal context, the specific Rule Number and Title are prepended as metadata to every sub-chunk generated from that section."
